/**
 * Space Language Model (SLM) is a Space model of the Space language itself. This model
 * defines basic language elements along with views and rules. Could eventually
 * hold enough information to run a Space executive although I'm not sure that
 * makes sense because one would always need an underlying executive. We might however,
 * code-generate various executives for Java, Javascript, C, etc..
