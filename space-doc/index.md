# Space The Language
##_by Jim Coles_

An OOP _type_ is nothing but a set of primitive types with superimposed constraints, i.e., Rules.
Even something as basic an integer is just a constrained sequence of bytes.
So, perhaps an entire language can be built up from the notion of a
'byte array (sequence) with constraints'. I'm referring to the abstract language,
not the source code of that abstract language.
